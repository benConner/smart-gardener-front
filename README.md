# smart-gardener-front
The front end to my Smart Gardener api

This uses the JavaScript framework angular for the application and materialize for styling.

It displays information for growing many fruits and vegetables.

All data is being pulled from Smart Gardener API that I built for this.

Allows users to build gardens they are planting and save plants to that garden for quick access.

Version 2 will have Garden optimization and plants sorted by plantable regions.
